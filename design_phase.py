# This code was developed by Meryem Kolbasar for the 4.49 Software Engineering assignment.

# Step 4: System Design and UML Diagrams (Conceptual)
# We will design the system using Python classes and functions. 
# UML diagrams are not represented in code, but here we outline the design.

# Design a class structure for phishing detection

class PhishingDetector:
    """
    This class represents the phishing website detection system.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        # Initialize the phishing detection model (placeholder for ML model)
        self.model = None

    def load_model(self, model_path):
        """
        Load a pre-trained machine learning model from the specified path.
        """
        # Placeholder code to load a model (for now, we'll simulate with a simple function)
        print(f"Loading model from {model_path}")
        self.model = lambda x: 1 if "phishing" in x.lower() else 0

    def predict(self, url):
        """
        Predict whether the given URL is phishing or not.
        """
        if not self.model:
            raise ValueError("Model is not loaded.")
        # Apply the model to predict the URL type
        result = self.model(url)
        return "Phishing" if result == 1 else "Safe"

# Step 5: Prototyping User Interface (UI) - Since it's backend-based, UI isn't developed here.

print("System design phase completed.")
